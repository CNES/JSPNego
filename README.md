# JSPNego
This JAVA library is built to make HTTP requests through/without a proxy. Several proxies are 
supported :
<ul>
<li>Proxy without authentication</li>
<li>Proxy with basic authentication</li>
<li>Proxy with JSPNego with JAAS configuration file</li>
<li>Proxy with JSPNego using the API</li>
</ul> 
JSPNego is a Single Sign On (SSO). This SSO uses <i>The Simple and Protected GSS-API Negotiation 
Mechanism (IETF RFC 2478)</i> (<b>SPNEGO</b>) as authentication protocol.
