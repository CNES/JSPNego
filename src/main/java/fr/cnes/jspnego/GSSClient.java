/**
 * Creates a Kerberos client and manages the logging into the Kerberos The <i>key distribution
 * center</i> (<b>KDC</b>) to acquire the <i>ticket granting ticket</i> (<b>TGT</b>).
 *
 * The <i>key distribution center</i> <b>KDC</b> is the component that houses both the
 * <i>ticket granting service</i> (<b>TGS</b>) and <i>authentication service</i> (<b>AS</b>). The
 * <b>KDC</b>, along with the client, or principal, and server, or secured service, are the three
 * pieces required to perform Kerberos authentication.
 *
 * The <i>ticket granting service</i> <b>TGS</b> is responsible for issuing <i>service tickets</i>
 * (<b>ST</b>) and specific session information to principals and the target server they are
 * attempting to access. This is based on the <b>TGT</b> and destination information provided by the
 * principal. This <b>ST</b> and session information is then used to establish a connection to the
 * destination and access the desired secured service or resource.
 *
 * The <i>authentication service</i> <b>AS</b> challenges principals to log in when they first log
 * into the network. The <b>AS</b> is responsible for issuing a <b>TGT</b>, which is needed for
 * authenticating against the <b>TGS</b> and subsequent access to secured services and resources.
 *
 * A <i>ticket granting ticket</i> <b>TGT</b> is a type of ticket (or token) issued to a principal
 * by the <b>AS</b>. The <b>TGT</b> is granted once a principal successfully authenticates against
 * the <b>AS</b> using their username and password. The <b>TGT</b> is cached locally by the client,
 * but is encrypted such that only the <b>KDC</b> can read it and is unreadable by the client. This
 * allows the <b>AS</b> to securely store authorization data and other information in the
 * <b>TGT</b> for use by the <b>TGS</b> and enables the <b>TGS</b> to make authorization decisions
 * using this data.
 *
 * A <i>service ticket</i> (<b>ST</b>) is a type of ticket issued to a principal by the TGS based on
 * their TGT and the intended destination. The principal provides the TGS with their TGT and the
 * intended destination, and the TGS verifies the principal has access to the destination based on
 * the authorization data in the TGT. If successful, the TGS issues an ST to the client for both the
 * client as well as the destination server which is the server containing the secured service or
 * resource. This grants the client access to the destination server. The ST, which is cached by the
 * client and readable by both the client and server, also contains session information that allows
 * the client and server to communicate securely.
